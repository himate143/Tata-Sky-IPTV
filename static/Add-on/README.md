# Add-on
Here are the add-on scripts to enhance your playlist file
#

>filter-url.php

Use an existing file or from the URL, sort it according to the data from the channels.txt file, and replace the License URL with your server URL

>filter-gist.php

Use an existing file or from the URL, sort it according to the data from the channels.txt file, and upload it to gist.

>extract-id-name.php

You can extract only id, name, or id with name from your playlist


### channels.txt
The data needs to be a tvg id; optionally, you can add a channel name for convenience.


e.g.
```
8
8 - STAR Plus HD
8 - Star plus
```
> PS - If channels.txt is empty or does not exist, then it will process the playlist as it is without any sorting.
